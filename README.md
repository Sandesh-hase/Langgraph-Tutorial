This repository contains notebooks, examples, and images used in the LangGraph end-to-end video series. The goal is to help developers build modular, observable, and production-ready AI agent workflows using LangGraph.

**Contents**
- Notebooks demonstrating LangGraph concepts and workflows.
- Visual assets used in the tutorials.

**Series Overview**

This tutorial series covers:
- Fundamentals: nodes, edges, state, and graph execution.
- Building LangGraph apps from scratch using Python notebooks.
- Visualizing graphs and inspecting execution traces.
- Real-world projects and use-cases demonstrating production patterns.
- Observability and debugging with LangSmith or similar tracing tools.

**LangSmith Integration**

LangSmith is used throughout the series to trace and debug LangGraph workflows. It provides:
- Detailed execution traces for each graph run.
- Insights into node-level performance and state transitions.
- Tools for debugging and optimizing workflows.
